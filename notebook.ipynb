"# The data ",
" ",
"❓ Question ❓ First, let's load the data. Here, it is the IMDB reviews again, but we are only interested in the sentences, not the positiveness or negativeness of the review. ",
" ",
"⚠️ **Warning** ⚠️ The `load_data` function has a `percentage_of_sentences` argument. Depending on your computer, there are chances that a too large number of sentences will make your compute slow down, or even freeze - your RAM can even overflow. For that reason, you can start with 20% of the sentences and see if your computer handles it. Otherwise, rerun with a lower number. On the other hand, you can increase the number if you feel like it. ",
" ",
"**At the end of the notebook, to improve the model, you would maybe need to increase the number of loaded sentences**"
